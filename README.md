## Assignment 2: xyes
The xyes is a shell-executable command-line program that echoes the command line arguments to standard output. The program has three different test cases:
If the user does not specify any arguments with the jar file associated with the xyes program, the default function of the program would be to print out “hello world”.
If the user specifies a limit by typing “-limit” before a command, the program will print out 20 lines of the argument.
If the user does not specify a limit before a command, the program will continuously print out the argument and if there are no arguments it will print out “hello world” infinitely.
