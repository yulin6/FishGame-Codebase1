- the data definition, including interpretation, of penguin movements for turns
  - minimaxGain() : <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/34d026e8bdcb85ae8a83e35fcc605d6a55074047/Fish/Common/Fish/src/player/Strategy.java#L43-L211>

  - MovePenguinAction class : <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/34d026e8bdcb85ae8a83e35fcc605d6a55074047/Fish/Common/Fish/src/common/models/Actions/MovePenguinAction.java#L8-L92>
  - IAction interface ï¼š <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/34d026e8bdcb85ae8a83e35fcc605d6a55074047/Fish/Common/Fish/src/common/models/Actions/IAction.java#L5-L20>

- the unit tests for the penguin placement strategy 
  - <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/34d026e8bdcb85ae8a83e35fcc605d6a55074047/Fish/Common/Fish/test/player/StrategyTest.java#L63-L184>

- the unit tests for the penguin movement strategy; 
  given that the exploration depth is a parameter `N`, there should be at least two unit tests for different depths 
  - <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/34d026e8bdcb85ae8a83e35fcc605d6a55074047/Fish/Common/Fish/test/player/StrategyTest.java#L186-L427>
  
- any game-tree functionality you had to add to create the `xtest` test harness:
  - where the functionality is defined in `game-tree.PP`
  - where the functionality is used in `xtree`
  - you may wish to submit a `git-diff` for `game-tree` and any auxiliary modules 
    - No we did no add any new functionality to our game tree component.
