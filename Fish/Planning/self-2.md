## Self-Evaluation Form for Milestone 2

A fundamental guideline of Fundamentals I, II, and OOD is to design
methods and functions systematically, starting with a signature, a
clear purpose statement (possibly illustrated with examples), and
unit tests.

Under each of the following elements below, indicate below where your
TAs can find:

- the data description of tiles, including an interpretation:
    - <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/a9b77648d31afcb0de664401b6d59446c52c65ae/Fish/Common/Fish/src/models/FishTile.java#L6> 
    - FishTile class is an interpretaion of the game board tile, it contains three parameters: isEmpty - a boolean that is used for checking if the tile is a hole or not, fishNum - an int that represents the number of the fishes on the tile, penguin - a Penguin class which can be null, representing no penguin on the tile, or if it is not null, then there is a penguin on the tile. We also have setters and getters for each parameter.

- the data description of boards, include an interpretation:
    - <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/a9b77648d31afcb0de664401b6d59446c52c65ae/Fish/Common/Fish/src/models/FishModel.java#L11> 
    - Our board interpretation is a ArrayList of ArrayList of FishTiles, in which the inner ArrayList is a row, and each FishTiles in the same row represents a different colomn. You can picture that the origin of game board is located on top-left corner, positive x goes to the right, positive y goes to the bottom. 

- the functionality for removing a tile:
   - <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/a9b77648d31afcb0de664401b6d59446c52c65ae/Fish/Common/Fish/src/models/FishModel.java#L57-L78>
  - purpose: The method will take in a x position and a y position (ints), which will be used for emptying the tile in the board, setting the isEmpty attribute of the tile to true. An empty tile represents a hole on the game board.
  
  - signature: 
        - @param xPos: x position (int) of the tile to be emptied.
        - @param yPos: y position (int) of the tile to be emptied.
  
  - unit tests: <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/a9b77648d31afcb0de664401b6d59446c52c65ae/Fish/Common/Fish/test/FishModelTest.java#L33-L152>

- the functiinality for reaching other tiles on the board:
    - <https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/a9b77648d31afcb0de664401b6d59446c52c65ae/Fish/Common/Fish/src/models/FishModel.java#L80-L212>
  - purpose: Takes in the x and y positions (ints) of starting tile and targeting tile, and determine if they are in a "straight line", which means the line connects the two tiles can only be crossing borders; and if they or any of the tiles in between them are empty, return false. Otherwise, return true.
  
  - signature: 
        - @param startX: x position (int) of the starting tile.
        - @param startY: y position (int) of the starting tile.
        - @param targetX: x position (int) of the targeting tile.
        - @param targetY: y position (int) of the targeting tile.
        - @return boolean that represents if the move attempt from the start tile to the target tile is valid or not.
  
  - unit tests:<https://github.ccs.neu.edu/CS4500-F20/annetta/blob/a9b77648d31afcb0de664401b6d59446c52c65ae/Fish/Common/Fish/test/FishModelTest.java#L154-L446>

The ideal feedback is a GitHub perma-link to the range of lines in specific
file or a collection of files for each of the above bullet points.

  WARNING: all such links must point to your commit "a9b77648d31afcb0de664401b6d59446c52c65ae".
  Any bad links will result in a zero score for this self-evaluation.
  Here is an example link:

A lesser alternative is to specify paths to files and, if files are
longer than a laptop screen, positions within files are appropriate
responses.

In either case you may wish to, beneath each snippet of code you
indicate, add a line or two of commentary that explains how you think
the specified code snippets answers the request.
